General Gameplay
----------------
* Character is controlled via tank controls in open world style map. 
* Mini-games are activated to progress through the level, similar to how an rpg battle would warp the player to a battle screen
* Level will be broken off into sections
* These sections will be accessed via rooms or conveyor belts

Story
------
* If we have time we will go back and make the choices the player makes affect the ending.
* Any Dialogue will be displayed through on screen dialogue boxes
* Choices made can be framed as ethical dilemmas (maybe choosing if a robot that clearly is not self aware lives or dies)
